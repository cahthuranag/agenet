# Theory
## overview 

This section explains the theoretical basis for this system model. In this system, we analyze the age of information of a wireless communication model with several nodes.Â 
### Simulation Parameters

#### maincom function
In the maincom function, we consider the following parameters when calculating the age of information theoretically and through simulation.
